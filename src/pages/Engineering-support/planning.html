        <h1 class="text-[#707070]">Engineering Planning & IT Systems consists of the following four departments:</h1>

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-medium mt-3">Asset Life Cycle Management</h1>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">ALCM is responsible for ensuring compliance with regulatory authority regulations from the point a new <br> aircraft is delivered   to Emirates, right the way through to when that aircraft is returned to the organisation <br> that owns it (Lessor). It does this by ensuring it maintains the  highest standard of data quality and aircraft <br> records. It is responsible for the inputting of technical data, the transaction of components replaced on <br>  each aircraft, digitally scanning every single sheet of documentation, and making it available electronically, <br> for the rest of the organisation to use and  refer to.
        </h1>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">It is responsible for ensuring the continued airworthiness of the Emirates fleet and it does this by <br> constantly auditing all   the data it retains, producing and verifying reports that are used for production of <br> Airworthiness Release Certificates for each aircraft. It also verifies  every single transaction conducted, has <br> the responsibility of managing landing gear overhaul programs and ensuring engines returning from shop <br> visits  will meet intended return conditions when handed back to the owners. It also manages the return of <br> the aircraft/engines at the end of their Lease periods. A  dedicated Team ensures that every return <br> condition, set out in the Lease agreement, is fulfilled by Emirates without financial penalty.</h1>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">ALCM personnel work 365 days of the year. They are highly skilled and they play a pivotal role in ensuring <br> continued   airworthiness is maintained right across the fleet of EK aircraft.</h1>


        <h1 class="text-4xl font-medium mt-14">Operational Planning</h1>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">The Operational Planning section consists of Aircraft Scheduling, Line Planning, Line Support Planning, Base <br> Operations  Planning, Base Heavy Planning and Projects teams.</h1>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Operational Planning are responsible for ensuring available aircraft ground-time in direct coordination with <br> work scoping,   planning functions and processes and packaging control for all scheduled maintenance <br> ground-time for its maintenance teams in Line Maintenance, Line Support   Maintenance, Base Operations <br> and Base Heavy Maintenance with the major functions:</h1>

        <li class="text-[#707070] mt-3">Aircraft Scheduling:</li>
        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Determine long-range, medium-range and short range plans, steer budget decisions and dictate the <br> ground time required to   accomplish maintenance work, with the minimum disruption to the flight <br> schedule. It plays a vital role in planning maintenance slots with Line maintenance,  <br> Base maintenance and third parties for all Emirates fleet.</h1>

        <li class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Work scoping:</li>
        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Responsible for the definition of scheduled work packages which produce consistent packages of work <br> to the production  departments to allow accurate forward planning of hangar workspace and the <br> associated manpower requirements to complete all maintenance required at the   optimum time. Review, <br> plan and work scope maintenance requirements for execution, balance scheduled work load within <br> given maintenance capacity   constraints along with timely issuance and control of work packages to <br> maintenance teams.</h1>

        <li class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Modification Planning:</li>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Provide vital planning and support services so that maintenance teams can carry out smooth, effective <br> maintenance and repair   on the Emirates fleet, ensuring minimum aircraft ground time, undisrupted <br> workflow and optimum turnaround time. This can be as simple as adding a new model  of soap <br> dispenser to the lavatories or completing major structural improvements to sections of the aircraft that <br> have been found susceptible to fatigue  or age related structural defects that may have been discovered <br> during the life of the aircraft. Liaison with manufacturer’s working parties for modification   support is <br> also a vital function of this cell. Liaison with the Materials Management Section to ensure parts and tools <br> required to support the  modification campaign are planned to be available to meet the modification <br> timeline.</h1>

        <li class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Special Projects:</li>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Support for specific activities such as the workscoping of End of Lease aircraft workpackages and <br> management of outsourced   aircraft maintenance and the planning and management of aircraft in <br> parking or storage condition.</h1>

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-medium mt-16">Reliability</h1>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">The main purpose of the Emirates Reliability Program is to establish and continuously monitor the <br> maintenance program  effectiveness for the fleet of Emirates aircraft and through continual monitoring <br> provides case evidence to trigger investigations in adverse trends and/or   support the effectiveness of the <br> maintenance program during escalation or de-escalation investigations by maintenance planning.</h1>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Technical and Reliability data pertaining to aircraft operations is gathered, analysed and periodically <br> presented in   consolidated Reliability Reports enabling technical decisions to improve aircraft safety, <br> reliability and to reduce maintenance cost. Ensures adherence to   all applicable civil aviation regulations. <br> Manage and monitor ETOPS, RVSM and Autoland reliability. Lead the Fleet Reliability Working Group <br> meetings   including setting the agenda and deciding topics for discussion. Recommend actions to Fleet <br> Managers, Fleet Engineers and Maintenance Program Manager based  on reliability data analysis and <br> insights for the purposes of optimizing the maintenance program. Reviews all reliability action item <br> responses and  validates the response is acceptable prior to closing.
        </h1>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Responsible towards development of reliability metrics to be tracked across the fleet for the purposes of <br> measuring,   tracking and comparing fleet reliability. Accountable for identifying reliability trends and <br> emerging reliability issues for awareness and action by the   Fleet Manager and Engineering teams.</h1>

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-medium mt-16">Engineering IT Systems</h1>

        <h1 class="text-[#707070] mt-5">Emirates Engineering operates an organisation-wide, standardised digital technical environment, which is <br> managed,  maintained, and enhanced by the Engineering IT Systems section in alignment with Engineering’s <br> ENGage 2030 Digital vision.
